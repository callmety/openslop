A browser extension that hides AI-generated slop from your feed with a
single sensitivity slider. No accounts, no servers, no telemetry.

The first adapter ships against one large professional-networking site
where AI slop has become especially loud. The engine — preset catalog,
slop scorer, observer, popup, settings, session stats — is intentionally
site-agnostic, so adapters for other places where AI slop has taken over
(X, Reddit, Threads, Facebook, YouTube comments, anywhere a feed exists)
can be dropped in without touching the rest.

## What it does

![OpenSlop popup overlaid on a feed page, showing the Hide AI Posts toggle, the Slop Sensitivity slider at Scorched Earth, the Audit/Minimize/Hide segmented control, and a session donut chart with 17 hidden items split between AI Post and AI Slop categories.](./docs/popup-screenshot.png)

The popup is one screen — three small cards and a session donut:

1. **Hide AI Posts** — one-click toggle that hides posts whose text
   mentions "AI" and authors whose title includes "AI".
2. **Slop Sensitivity** — five-stop slider (Off → 🔥) that progressively
   suppresses AI-slop patterns: scam signals, lead-magnet funnels,
   engagement bait, hustle culture, AI hype, founder theater, motivational
   platitudes, and so on. Each stop is cumulative — see
   [`shared/presets.js`](./shared/presets.js) for the full catalog.
3. **Hidden-item mode** — segmented control choosing how matched posts are
   shown: **Audit** (keep visible with a reason strip), **Minimize**
   (collapse to a thin reason strip), or **Hide** (remove entirely).

Below those, the **session donut + live capsule** runs the whole session
you're browsing — categorized counts of what was hidden vs. shown,
refreshed live as the content script flags new posts.

That's it. Settings sync via `chrome.storage.sync` so a second browser
on the same Google/Microsoft account picks them up automatically.

## Install (developer mode)

There are no published GitHub releases and no Chrome Web Store / AMO
listing. Install from source:

**Chrome / Edge / Brave / other Chromium**
1. Open `chrome://extensions`.
2. Toggle **Developer mode** (top-right).
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select this folder.

**Firefox**
1. Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
2. Click **Load Temporary Add-on** and select `manifest.firefox.json` inside
   this folder.

## Privacy

OpenSlop runs entirely in your browser. It stores settings in `chrome.storage`
and reads the page DOM. It makes **no network requests of any kind** — no
`fetch`, no analytics, no telemetry, no third-party servers.

See [PRIVACY.md](./PRIVACY.md) for the long version and
[docs/PERMISSIONS.md](./docs/PERMISSIONS.md) for the per-permission rationale.

## Architecture at a glance

```
popup/  ── settings via chrome.storage ──▶  content/  ── observes ──▶  site adapter
   ▲                                            │                       (currently one)
   └──────── session stats via chrome.storage ──┘
```

Three independent processes that only talk through `chrome.storage` —
no message-passing between the popup and the content script, no network.
The detection layers (presets, slop scorer, observer, popup) are
site-agnostic; per-site DOM knowledge lives in `shared/constants.js`
and a small set of content modules.
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) has the full file map.

### Project status

- **Manifest V3** (Chrome) and **Manifest V2** (Firefox) ship from a
  single source tree; both manifests are kept in lockstep by
  `npm run validate:extension`.
- **Two permissions** total: `storage` plus the host scope of the
  currently shipping adapter. No `tabs`, no `scripting`, no
  `webRequest`. See [`docs/PERMISSIONS.md`](./docs/PERMISSIONS.md).
- **Zero runtime dependencies.** All deps in `package.json` are
  `devDependencies` (Jest, ESLint, Playwright, jsdom). The shipped
  extension is plain `.js` + `.css` + `.html` — what you see in the
  source tree is what runs in the browser.
- **205 Jest unit tests across 16 files + a Playwright extension
  smoke spec** run on every PR via [CI](./.github/workflows/ci.yml). The smoke spec actually
  loads the extension into headless Chromium and asserts on real DOM
  behavior on fixture pages.
- **No store listing, no published releases.** `npm run build`
  produces `dist/openslop-chrome.zip` and `dist/openslop-firefox.zip`
  locally; install via developer mode (above).

## Develop (for forkers)

```bash
npm install
npm test                  # jest unit tests
npm run lint              # eslint, --max-warnings=0
npm run audit:branding    # legacy-name + denylist guard
npm run build             # dist/openslop-chrome.zip + dist/openslop-firefox.zip
npm run verify:release    # the full pre-PR check (everything above + e2e smoke)
```

[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) has the dev loop, the file map
pointer, and how to add a new preset term — useful if you fork.
